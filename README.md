   Step-by-step visual representation of the sorting algorithm, allowing students to observe how the array elements are sorted in real-time.

2. **Performance Analysis**  
   Real-time tracking and display of key metrics such as the number of comparisons and swaps, helping users understand the algorithm's efficiency.

3. **Questionnaire**  
   Dynamically generated multiple-choice questions that test students' understanding of the algorithm and its performance characteristics.

4. **Multi-language Support**  
   Implementation of the sorting algorithm in multiple programming languages including C, C++, Java, and Python, enabling students to compare different coding styles.

5. **Customizable Input**  
   Allows users to input their own arrays to sort, encouraging experimentation and deeper understanding.

6. **Adjustable Visualization Speed**  
   A slider control to adjust the speed of the sorting animation, accommodating different learning paces.

7. **Detailed Algorithm Explanation**  
   Comprehensive explanation of the sorting algorithm with an expandable "Read More" feature for in-depth learning.
